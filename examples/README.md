# CodeePy Example Code

# Getting started with CodeePy

## Requirements
CodeePy requires Python 3.4 to be installed on your machine, it can be downloaded for free from the [Python website.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
We recommend using [Pycharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) as your initial development tool, please note students, educators and educational facilities have free access to the professional version and there is also a free community version.

## Setting up your development environment

Create a new project, being sure to specify the Python 3.4 interpreter.
Open the terminal within PyCharm and install CodeePy with pip (which will also install any dependencies)
For more information regarding pip please visit our [module page](https://pypi.org/project/codeepy/)
